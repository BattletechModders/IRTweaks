# IRTweaks
This mod for the [HBS BattleTech](http://battletechgame.com/) game includes miscellaneous tweaks and changes that aren't large enough to justify a separate mod.

## Planned Changes

* No Called Shot to Head: You will be unable to select the head as a called target shot, unless the mech is shutdown
* Sensor Lock allows Movement: Sensor Lock will no longer end your movement
